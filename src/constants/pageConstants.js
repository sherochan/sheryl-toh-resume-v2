            ROLE: "Machine Learning Engineer",
            DESCRIPTION: "Working in a product development team under Deloitte Risk Advisory's Cognitive Analytics Solution Center of Excellence that develops a suite of Cognitive Sensing products for Risk Advisory business, I started out working on the existing pipeline that automates typical machine learning techniques such as data processing, feature engineering, model training and model evaluation to transform it into more scalable microservice that is in-line with the other applications built by the team. That was done using Python, Docker, ElasticSearch and Amazon Web Services(AWS) such as S3, EC2 and ECR. Together with an intern, we added new models into the pipeline to be deployed in our risk sensing product while working closely with the Software Engineers in the team. Subsequently, as I was interested in enhancing my Software Engineering skills, I took on jobs from the software engineering side, picking up React.js and assisting them on Frontend development as well as building API endpoints in the backend that connects with the pipeline built earlier on. I also worked on enhancing the pipeline, enabling it to perform batch inference on large datasets using AWS EMR instead of just for streaming data.",

            COMPANY: "JEWEL PAYMENTECH PTD LTD",
            ROLE: "Data Science Intern",
            DESCRIPTION: "I worked together with the Data Science and Development Team in an Agile environment. Using Python's machine learning and deep learning libraries such as SciKit-Learn and Keras, I built and experimented with basic machine learning models using Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and also developed complex multi-input Convolutional Neural Network models for one of the company's Fraud Detection application. I also explored various ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking) to improve the accuracy of the models. Towards the end of my internship, I experimented with building a simple image binary classification model by performing transfer learning using Keras's pretrained model such as InceptionV3 as the base model",

            ROLE: "Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning Intern",
            DESCRIPTION: "I worked together with other interns and my company supervisor to develop and enhance features on the product that aims to improve productivity for the end users. Using Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup, Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, I scraped and processed data from the web, and developed an unsupervised machine learning model using K-Means Clustering and maintained a simple binary supervised classification model using Support Vector Machine. An initial stage of a multiclass-classification model using One-VS-Rest approach on Support vector machine was also developed. I used Amazon Web Services(AWS), mainly the noSQL Database, DynamoDB, and AWS SDK for python, boto3 for storing the scraped data. Throughout my internship, I made monthly presentations on my progress and findings to the Management Team to keep them updated and introduced them to the various machine learning concepts.",
